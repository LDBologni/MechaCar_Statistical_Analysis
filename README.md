## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The results show that the ground clearance and vehicle length have a significant impact on mpg, as per the other variables as the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) indicate that provide a random amount of variance in the dataset.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The p-Value for this model is 5.35e-11, is a small number than could be assumed a significance level of 0.05%. Indicating that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The linear model depicts a R-squared value of 0.7149 (approximately 71.5%), indicating that the model will mostly predict correctly the values of the mpg in the model.
