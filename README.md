## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The results show that the ground clearance and vehicle length have a significant impact on mpg, as per the other variables as the vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and All Wheel Drive (AWD) indicate that provide a random amount of variance in the dataset.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The p-Value for this model is 5.35e-11, is a small number that indicates that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The linear model depicts a R-squared value of 0.7149 (approximately 71.5%), indicating that the model will mostly predict correctly the values of the mpg in the model.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

 Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
 
The Suspension Coil population depicts a Variance of 62.29 PSI, meaning that the Variance is withing 100 PSI variance requirement.

In addition reviewing the data of the lot individually the data displays the following:
